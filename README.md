## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**SugarcaneWeedDataset** consists of 2,139 high-resolution RGB images (4608Ã—3072) captured in sugarcane fields, annotated for:
- 869`sugarcane-only`
- 855 `weed-only`
- 415 `mixed`

This dataset addresses the real-world challenge of **green-on-green weed detection** in perennial crops, a scenario underrepresented in existing benchmarks.
